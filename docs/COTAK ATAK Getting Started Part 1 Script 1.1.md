**Intro**

“Welcome to COTAK, an advanced situational awareness tool that helps first responders communicate and coordinate effectively in the field. In this tutorial we will walk you through installation and setup of the Android Team Awareness Kit or ATAK for short.

**Installing ATAK**

“Let’s begin by installing the application on your device. Scan the QR code displayed on screen or navigate to the play store and search for TAK-civ. Download and open the application.”

**Initial Permissions**

Upon opening the application you will be prompted by several requests for permissions. You must agree to the End User License Agreement and follow the instructions provided on the app for allowing permissions to phone calls, pictures/videos, files, audio, SMS, and finally location. While this app requires more permissions than an average app, there is a valid reason for each request. ATAK allows you to place phone calls and text messages to other COTAK users, even if you don’t know their phone number, and the app allows you to take and share location-referenced pictures, among many other features. Please note that when the ATAK application is closed, you will no longer be sharing your location data or any other information.

**Connecting Device to Server**

After you have successfully completed the permissions settings  you will see the “TAK Device Setup” screen pop up. If you do not see this box, click on the 3 lines in the top right corner then scroll down and click on settings, support, and then initial device configurations  – The first task you will perform on this screen is to connect to the COTAK server using the “Quick Connect” button.

**Create Callsign Identity**

To create your callsign, click on callsign identity. You will be prompted with a text field to enter in your callsign. We suggest keeping your callsign concise while displaying the most important identifying information, bearing in mind that during mutual aid situations you may be working with other agencies from across the state using COTAK. We recommend using the callsign convention \[Agency Acronym\] \[Last Name\] \[Radio Callsign\].

**Team Colors**

Next we need to decide what color your marker will show as on the map. View this table to see which color you should choose.

**Roles**

Choose your role based on the table provided. If in doubt select the team member option.

**Channels**

The ATAK app will pop up a message asking you to ‘disable battery optimization,’ please accept this request. You may also see a message saying that ‘no channel has been selected’. This message refers to the channels tool in ATAK, which controls what COTAK channels you are on and is a key part of the COTAK system. 

Either tap “ok” on the popup, or if it does not appear tap on the channels tool and tap on the “COTAK” option. You will see a list of the channels that are available to your COTAK account. Tapping on the eyeball icon next to the channel turns it on, which shares your location with all other users on that same channel and enables you to interact with the users. Turning a channel off removes your location and presence from that channel. 

Each COTAK first responder sees a unique list of channels based on your login. Some of these channels were created by your agency administrator and are only available to members of your public safety organization, while other channels are available to multiple agencies for use in mutual aid. The COTAK team recommends only turning on mutual aid channels when a need for them arises, but refer to your own agency’s policies for definitive guidance. 

**Notification Settings**

By default ATAK creates a system notification every time a new map marker appears. This can become burdensome when channels with a high number of map markers, such as the aircraft tracking channel, are turned on. To lower the number of notifications from ATAK navigate to your device’s notification settings, and tap on the “ATAK” app, then tap on ‘notification categories’ and turn off the top-most notification category.
