Welcome to COTAK, a platform to view and share location-based information ideal for first responders in Colorado. COTAK is simply Colorado’s user management system for a collection of apps and software in the TAK (or Team Awareness Kit) Family. Android, IOS, Windows and Web version are all available each with their benefits and tradeoffs.

TAK was initially built by the Department of Defense to track military assets on the battlefield, however we believe the current version has the ability for first responders to collaborate and coordinate better than ever before.

COTAK is organized in a local control model. Each agency has an internal administrator that adds and deletes users and creates channels for different groups within their agency.

Channels are a unique way, similar to DTR talk groups, to manage a vast amount of information into smaller more usable pieces. For example, a small intel unit in a large metropolitan police department may not need access to the daily activities of a patrol section so they would have a rather restricted channel, but in the event of a large or critical event, they could switch to a MAC channel and work with patrol, or even other agencies of different types (think fire or EMS).

As with any technology there are glitches from time to time; however, pilot agencies have found the varieties of TAK to be a robust tool that enhances cooperation and organization – the very thing that challenges first responders every day.

Simply put, TAK is dots on a map – any map you choose. Some use common navigation maps while others use maps with house numbers on them. TAK is extremely versatile in customizing how you see location information.  

The state of Colorado’s Center of Excellence has been the driver of this program developing the backend networking and web interface that makes using TAK far more approachable than in recent years. Frankly TAK was difficult to implement on a large scale because of its initial architecture. The CoE as addressed these challenges aggressively to produce a product for anyone that’s familiar with logging into a website. It’s that easy.

Regardless of device type, Android, IOS, Windows or Web – all can share location data as well as a myriad of maps, markers of interest and so much more. Most excitingly, is the ability to integrate CAD data points, vehicle trackers, Satellite trackers, fire perimeter polygons and essentially anything that would make sense to put on a map. TAK was built to “consume” and display what you’d want to know about your resources in daily and/or critical operations.

TAK apps are freely available in common apps stores; however, that does not mean any random user can join your agency’s channel. Just like someone could purchase a DTR radio on ebay does not mean they can get it programmed to use your radio channel. TAK agency administrators hold the key to collaborating as small or broadly as you like. That’s up to you.

Many resources around the state are already integrated into TAK including some of the state’s own aircraft. These have been used for wildfire, SAR and more limitedly for law enforcement. 

One of the main goals the CoE is trying to accomplish with the COTAK project is to make location-based data available in mutual aid scenarios. Sometimes neighboring agencies have systems in place to make do, but TAK offers a way to definitively know where mutual aid resources are without tying up precious airtime on a radio channel. Pilot agencies have found the reduced need for radio traffic describing locations as a remarkable secondary benefit to using TAK. The supervisor or dispatcher know where their resources are nearly up to the second without a word from their units.

Finally, joining COTAK is as easy as visiting a website. Cotak.gov enables you to claim an available agency or create a new one if you’re not in our database. The next step is to create users, then channels for those users. All users have to do is download the app, create their password and follow a brief procedure to login to the app. All of this is explained in quick start videos available on cotak.gov. Many agencies have started this process without ever asking for help. It’s that easy. Our intent is to make it a simple as possible for agencies to begin collaborating. Thank you for taking the time to learn about Colorado’s TAK program – COTAK.
