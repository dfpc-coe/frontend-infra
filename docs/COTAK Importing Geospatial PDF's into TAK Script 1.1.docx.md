Hello and welcome to the Center of Excellence training series on TAK. In this tutorial we will cover two examples of importing GeoPDFs into TAK,  including sourcing USGS Map Quads and Incident Action Plan Maps. Let’s get started.  
   
The US Geological Survey has an easy to use website tool for downloading map quads. In your search bar type NGMDB. Click National Geologic Map Database, then select topo view from the bottom toolbar. On the top toolbar select Get Maps.

Either zoom and tap an area of interest on the map, or type a location into the search bar. When you find an area of interest, the name of the Quad will appear with several options including when the map was made. We recommend clicking the show button to confirm the map version selected is what you actually want to use. Sometimes the thumbnails to the right of the map version aren’t very clear.

Be attentive to the map scale as most people will want to use the traditional 1 to 24,000 scale. Others, such as, 1 to 100,000 may not provide enough detail to be useful.

To download, click the geopdf button and save it to your device – most will choose the download folder. This works in WinTAK, ATAK or iTAK. 

For wintak and atak use the import tool in the main menu and select the map file. Image Overlay File will overlay the GeoPDF on your existing basemap whereas imagery will use the GeoPDF as a basemap. To toggle the image overlay file on or off navigate to overlays then image overlays. To toggle the imagery option navigate to the trifold map tool then click maps and pdf. 

 For iTAK, tap the layers button, then overlays, the \+ button, then local device and choose the file.

. For iTAK use layers, then overlays to toggle.

To download a map from an incident action plan \- begin by scanning the QR code on the first page of the document. Select maps, the desired day, and the desired map. Download the map to your device and complete the same steps for importing the maps onto your TAK Device.

This concludes our tutorial for downloading offline GeoPDFs, powered by the Colorado Department of Public Safety and the Center of Excellence for Advanced Technology Aerial Firefighting. Thanks for watching\!
